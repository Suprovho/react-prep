But how does it all work behind the scenes?

summary->

When you create elements in React, you're actually creating
virtual DOM objects. These virtual replicas are synced with the
real DOM, a process known as "Reconciliation" or the React
"diffing" algorithm.
Essentially, every rendering cycle compares the new UI blueprint
(updated VDOM) with the old one (previous VDOM) and makes
precise changes to the actual DOM accordingly.



reconciliation Algorithm -> also known as react fiber(react 16)

virtual dom is the representation of the actual dom.

virtual dom is a normal js object  which contain react elements.

diff algorithm find the difference between previous virtual dom and present virtual dom ex- on click on a button state changes such as from 4 card to 3 card 

and then it will update the actual dom with difference on every render cycle.

it find the diff between 2 object and change actual dom and rerender which update the ui.

why react is fast ?

because it do efficient dom manipulation. by finding the difference between virtual dom and update the ui. 

th's why in use state we have two ele 2nd one keep the track and as soon as it is called it process reconciliation algorithm

- The crucial point about State variables is that
whenever they update, React triggers a reconciliation
cycle and re-renders the component.

- This means that as soon as the data layer changes,
React promptly updates the UI layer. The data layer is
always kept in sync with the UI layer.
